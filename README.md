# g-CodeCoverage

Template project for setting up a C++ development project with unit tests
and code coverage analysis.

For testing, most likely only googletest is used.
Other test frameworks like catch, lest, cute, lack the tight integration with
a mock framework.

Planned Branches:
- make: template for plain Makefiles and code editors.
- eclipse: template for eclipse CDT.
- qtcreator: template for qtcreator which will _not_ use the Qt library.
- clion: template for Jetbrains' C++ IDE.
